    <h2>Where are white tigers found?</h2>
    <p>White tigers are primarily found in captivity today, as they no longer exist in the wild. Originally, these animals were native to the dense forests and grasslands of India, where they lived alongside Bengal tigers. Regions such as <b>Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, and Assam</b> once provided the perfect environment for them to live. However, due to <b>habitat loss and hunting</b>, wild white tigers disappeared decades ago. The white tigers we see today live in zoos, sanctuaries, and wildlife parks around the world, where they are bred and cared for.</p>
