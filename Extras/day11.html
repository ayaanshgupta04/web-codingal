    <h1>Objects in Space</h1>

        <h2>Stars</h2>

            Stars are giant balls of hot gas - mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Astronomers 
            estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars - that's a one followed by 24 zeros. Our Milky Way 
            alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.

            Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun. Although asteroids orbit the sun like planets, they are much smaller 
            than planets. Asteroids are left over from the formation of our solar system.

        <h2>Planets</h2>

        <p>
            A planet is a large, round celestial body that orbits a star, is not a star itself, and is massive enough for its gravity to clear
            its orbital path of other objects. The eight planets in our solar system are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, 
            and Neptune.
