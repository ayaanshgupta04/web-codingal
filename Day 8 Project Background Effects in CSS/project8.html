  <h1>The Milky Way</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>An Introduction to our Galaxy</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Milky Way</b> is the <i>galaxy</i> that contains our <strong>Solar System</strong>. 
      It is a vast collection of stars, planets, and cosmic dust bound together by <em>gravity</em>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It contains over <b>100 billion stars</b>.</li>
      <li>Our <i>Sun</i> is located in one of its spiral arms called the <strong>Orion Arm</strong>.</li>
      <li>The Milky Way is about <em>13.6 billion years old</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Origins of the Milky Way</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>origin</b> of the <strong>Milky Way Galaxy</strong> dates back to the early stages of the 
      <i>universe's formation</i>. Scientists believe it began as a group of small gas clouds and 
      <em>dark matter</em> that gradually merged through gravity to form a much larger, structured galaxy. 
      Over billions of years, it evolved into the vast spiral galaxy we see today.

    <h2>The Milky Way in the Future</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>future</b> of the <strong>Milky Way Galaxy</strong> holds mojor changes. Over the next few 
      billion years, our galaxy will continue to <i>evolve</i> as new stars form and old ones fade. 
      Scientists predict that in about <b>4 billion years</b>, the Milky Way will <em>collide</em> with the 
      nearby <strong>Andromeda Galaxy</strong>, merging into a giant elliptical system sometimes called <i>Milkomeda</i>. 
      Despite this immense event, the vast distances between stars mean few direct collisions will occur, and our 
      <em>Solar System</em> may drift to a new region of the combined galaxy.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Milky Way Galaxy</b> is an very interesting topic about space and our universe. From its mysterious <i>origins</i> 
      billions of years ago to its fascinating <em>future</em> merger with the <strong>Andromeda Galaxy</strong>, the Milky Way 
      continues to remind us of the true scale of our universe and how tiny the Earth is compared to the rest.
