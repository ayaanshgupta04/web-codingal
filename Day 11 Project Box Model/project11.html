    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <p>
        Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa'], Neapolitan: ['pittsɘ']) is a savory dish of Italian origin
        consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
        tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms,
        onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
        traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A
        person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
